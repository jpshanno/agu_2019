This repo contains everything but the raw data to create my poster from the AGU
Fall Meeting 2019. The poster is titled Runoff and Stream Water Chemistry
Responses to Simulated Emearld Ash Borer Invasion in Black Ash Wetlands in
Northern Michigan (H53L-1950). 

**In order to use the posterdown_hybrid template in this poster you currently 
need to use my forked version of Brent Thorne's great [posterdown package](https://github.com/brentthorne/posterdown), 
which can be found at [jpshanno/posterdown](https://github.com/jpshanno/posterdown).**
